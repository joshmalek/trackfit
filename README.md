# trackfit
A fitness tracker built with the MERN stack.  The tracker takes input in the form of username, exercise and length of exercise.  It can then allow a user to view their exercises, or add new ones.

The MERN stack consists of:

    MongoDB: document-based open source database
    Express: web application framework for Node.js
    React: Javascript front end library for building UIs
    Node.js: Javascript run-time enviroment that executes Javascript code outside of a browser
    Mongoose: schema-based solution to model application data
